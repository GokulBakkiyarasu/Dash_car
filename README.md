Turtle Crossing Game using Python and OOPs Concepts

This project is a simple implementation of the popular Turtle Crossing game using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) concepts. The game involves helping a turtle cross a busy street by avoiding obstacles and collecting points. The user controls the turtle using the arrow keys on their keyboard.



    Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone 
    Ensure that you have Python 3 installed.
    Install the turtle module, which is a standard Python library.
    Run python turtle_crossing_game.py to start the game.

How to Play

    Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the turtle up, down, left, or right.
    Avoid the cars on the road and the water in the river.
    Collect points by reaching the other side of the road and river.
    If you are hit by a car or fall in the water, the game is over.
    Your score will be displayed at the end of the game.
